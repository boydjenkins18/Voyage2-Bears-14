Welcome to our project. We're a team of a few folks trying to build something of great relative import. This site build, while on the surface but a simple reverse-engineering and re-imagining of the Jobbatical website, is much more to us. We are using it to establish/enhance/exhibit our litany of web dev talents both to bolster our burgeoning career pursuits and improve the lives of our compatriots in the same boat. What does that actually mean you ask? Stick around to find out, big stuff in the pipeline!

## Getting Started

For those on the team, or those curious external wanderers who stumble across our humble repo, these instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Download/clone repo to your desktop.
2. Enter the created directory.
```
cd mynewdirectory
```
3. Run npm install in said directory to populate the required node modules
```
npm install
```

From here, things could get messy (this will be a very active repo dev-wise for at least a few months). No guarantees on a usable app at this point, but maybe you can try npm start and see what happens at any given point. For general run/build/package commands, and to understand the Create-React-App basis for the project, see:
